This comprehensive code base is designed for analyzing HCP (Human Connectome Project) task-based fMRI data. Here's a high-level summary and guidance for effectively using the provided notebook:
Summary of Features and Functionality:

    Setup and Installation:
        Installs required libraries like nilearn and brainiak for neuroimaging analysis.
        Configures global variables (number of subjects, parcels, etc.) and visualization settings.

    Data Loading and Organization:
        Downloads and extracts HCP parcellated fMRI data (hcp_task.tgz).
        Defines folder structure, with nested directories for subjects, experiments, runs, and conditions.

    Helper Functions:
        Provides tools for loading time series, experimental variables (EVs), and regions.
        Includes a function for convolving regressors with the Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF).

    Data Preparation:
        Constructs signals (S) and regressors (R) for each subject, experiment, and parcel.
        Computes beta weights (B) to model relationships between task regressors and BOLD signals.

    Beta Matrix and Visualization:
        Computes and stores beta matrices for all subjects and experiments.
        Offers a visualization function to inspect beta weights as a heatmap.

    Activity Analysis:
        Extracts and contrasts brain activity for specific conditions (e.g., fear vs. neutral) in a selected experiment.
        Visualizes differences in activity across regions of interest (ROIs).

Key Functions and Their Use Cases:

    load_single_timeseries()
        Loads parcellated fMRI data for a single subject, experiment, and run.

    build_S() and build_R()
        Constructs the signal matrix (S) and regressor matrix (R) for fMRI data modeling.

    solve_beta(S, R)
        Solves the linear model S=RBS=RB to estimate beta weights for each ROI.

    visualize_betas(subject, experiment)
        Visualizes beta weights as a heatmap for a given subject and experiment.

    stack_fear(subject, experiment, cond1, cond2)
        Stacks beta values for two conditions across subjects.

    average_frames()
        Computes the average activity for specific conditions (e.g., fear vs. neutral) within an experiment.
        Additional Notes:

    The dataset requires signing the HCP data use terms at ConnectomeDB before downloading.
    For computational efficiency, you can modify the list of experiments or subjects during beta computation.
    Make sure to adapt paths and configurations as per your system's requirements.

Next Steps:

    If you're running this for the first time, ensure that all dependencies are installed, and the dataset is correctly downloaded.
    Customize and extend the notebook to analyze other experiments or conditions (e.g., MOTOR, WM).
    Use the pickle mechanism to save and load intermediate results, avoiding redundant computations.
